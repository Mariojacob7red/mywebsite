		<p id="bodyfade">We at Nintendo realized just how many games systems out there are fan made versions of retro game systems, and some of them even play more than one type of video game. To celebrate how long Nintendo as a company has stayed up and going for this long, we decided to create the <b>Nintendo Retro</b><sup>&trade;</sup>. This revolutionary game system can play anything from the <i>Nintendo 64</i><sup>&trade;</sup> all the way up to the <i>Nintendo Switch</i><sup>&trade;</sup>. We also wanted to make the design of the system have a familiar aesthetic to it, so we used the design from the <i>Nintendo GameCube</i><sup>&trade;</sup> as reference.

    <h2 id="headerfade2" style="transition-delay: 0.5s;">The History of Nintendo<sup>&copy;</sup></h2>
		<p id="bodyfade2" style="transition-delay: 0.5s;">Nintendo<sup>&copy;</sup> didn't start off as a video game company. Nintendo<sup>&copy;</sup> was actually a hanafuda Japanese playing card company back in 1889 when they first started and the company's name was <i>Nintendo Karuta</i>. Many years later, around 1985, the worldwide phenomenon, Mario, was introduced and he would forever change the world. After that, Nintendo's history is pretty well known and they have been successful ever since.</p>

		<p id="bodyfade3" style="transition-delay: 1s;">Over the years, Nintendo<sup>&copy;</sup> has made many different consoles and handhelds, not just to prove that we're the best at what we make, but we create all of these products because we want to make something that the world will remember, even if it's not top of the notch. That's why, going forward, some of our products will not be entirely brand new, but will instead be a combination of a few of our past game consoles and handhelds that are brought together to make something truly incredible!</p>

		<!--<h3>Growing Up...</h3>
			<p>I was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas and I lived in Greenwood, Arkansas for the first 4 years of my life. In my whole life, I've moved 10 times and I've lived in 6 different towns or cities. There's Greenwood, AR; Van Buren, AR; Greenbriar, AR; Grove, OK; back to Greenbriar; Pottsville, AR; and then Branson, MO since 2008.</p>
		<h4>My Life on YouTube...</h4>
			<p>On April 26, 2012, I started a YouTube channel called Mariojacob7red. I first came up with the name from using some of my favorite things. I love <span class="important1">Mario</span>, my name is <span class="important1">Jacob</span>, my favorite number is <span class="important1">7</span>, and favorite color is <span class="important1">red</span>. I wanted to start that channel because I have fun making YouTube videos for other people to watch (even if I don't get a lot of views on them because of YouTube's messed up algorithm). So, for the pass 7 years (it'll be 8 years this Sunday, April 26, 2020!), I've been making videos mostly on Minecraft, Five Nights at Freddy's, Mario Kart Wii, and a lot more because I love doing that. A lot of other people try to follow the current trend or fad that's happening now, but I like to make and set my own trends and do what I want and enjoy the most because I won't regret it later. :)</p>
		<h4>The Future...</h4>
			<p>When I graduate from Southwest Baptist University in May 2022, I plan to work at Nintendo of America. But, if I don't get accepted to work there right away, they have a child company that's located in Texas. It's closer to Branson and I can try and work my way up to getting a job at Nintendo of America! :D</p>-->
